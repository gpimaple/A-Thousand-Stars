# A Thousand Stars

A small space video game that I created in 9th grade.

You can manuver a small spaceship around a field of asteroids using the left and right arrow keys to rotate and the up and down arrow keys to move. Press space to fire the guns. There is also an inventory that can be toggled with the `INVENTORY` button. The game includes object collision detection. All objects collide elastically in spheres, which are highlighted

![Large Asteroid](./res/screenshot2.png?raw=true "Large asteroid")

This is an eclipse project that can be imported. Alternatively, you could run

```bash
ant build
```

to build the project, and

```bash
java -cp bin/ mainPackage.Main
```
to run it.

The project is public domain and free to use for any purpose.
